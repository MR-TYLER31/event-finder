# Code-Breakers Event Hub

Event Hub is a group project where we built a application that will allows users to find events by event name or by city name in the navigation bar. Once the user adds the event name or city a list of events will with information about the event. User can click 'details' which will display a popup modal with additional details about the event and have a map with pin point of location.
